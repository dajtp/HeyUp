Notes:


Key Exchange: Need to implement Diffie-Hellman.

This program is broken up into numerous stages, each of which is a separate file. The stages are all contained within their own respective .py files within the dependancies folder. 

No serverside code is yet included in the repo. This is because the server is not yet implemented.
